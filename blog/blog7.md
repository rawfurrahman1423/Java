# Post 7:
I spent this week learning finally beginning the first part of my project. I spent 
the last few weeks learning and trying to understand the various concepts of Java. 
After learning all of the concepts, I have moved on to making small WebPages.  
These pages are responsive to what the user. For example, if the user types something 
into the bar, the page will display text based on what the user typed. These are 
my first steps to opening up Java and experimenting to make something much bigger 
and more complex.

## Running my IDE
I also spent most of the time learning about the website to use all of the Java 
that I have learned. I am using an IDE in the cloud called Codenvy. I have successfully
made the code run with html in the front end and java on the back end. 

# Takeaways
+ I need to manage my time more efficiently because I spent most of my time experimenting 
on my code rather than learning how to implement that code so it will actually run.

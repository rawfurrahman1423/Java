# Post 8:

I have made it to the Final Week of my project. However it did not turn out as good 
as I wanted it to be. One problem that I had was the IDE that I was using. I was 
using eclipse.che as an IDE on the cloud. It ran on Codenvy and so I could use it 
from place to place. However, although I was able to make it print with an HTML page 
and Java, it was very difficult to use. I ended up a local IDE called eclipse.

I downloaded Eclipse and started my work from scratch. I already had knowledge on 
how to use some of the files but after experimenting I was able to use it much easier. 
There were several files that I needed to download including an entire server so that 
I can could run the java code with html. So now I am in the process of making webpage 
with Java and preparing my presentation for everything that I learned. 


# Takeaways
+This week, I learned that when I am stuck, I should not lose confidence. What I 
did before that made me take so long to reach this point was whenever I was stuck
on something or found something difficult, I would leave it for later. I would just 
say to myself that I can always do it tomorrow. However this week I did not have the 
luxury of doing this. I was able to problem solve.

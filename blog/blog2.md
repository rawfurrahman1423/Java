# Post 2:
I started this week off feeling conflicted about what topic should do because 
this was the last time I would be able to change it. I ended up with two choices 
left. My choices were SASS and Java. SASS, short for Syntactically Awesome Style 
Sheets, is a more complex form of CSS. This lets you design and manipulate a 
pages so that it is easier and more enjoyable to use. Java on the other hand is 
another coding language that you can do almost anything with. It is a back end 
coding language. At the end, I decided to go with Java because it has more 
creative freedom.

## Java Syntax
After I choose to do Java, I went on and tried to learn the basic syntax of the 
language and I took notes. I learned about the following concepts:
+   Data Types are `int`, `boolean`, and `char`.
+	Variables are used to store values.
+	Whitespace helps make code easy to read for you and others.
+	Comments describe code and its purpose.
+	Arithmetic Operators include `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`.
+	Relational Operators include `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`.
+	Equality Operators include `==` and `!=`.

In order to run code, there must be a class. The rest of the code, such as 
integers, booleans, and characters,  will be in that class in order for it to opperate.

```Java
//Print my name
public class YourName {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		System.out.println("rawfur");

	}
}
```

The code Above creates a class called `YourName`. the rest of the code runs 
inside of the class, including the `System.out.println("rawfur");` which 
displays `YourName` or what ever is written in the parenthesis.


```Java
//Setting values for integer, boolean, and char variables
public class Variables {
	public static void main(String[] args) {

		int myNumber = 42;
		boolean isFun = true; 
		char movieRating = 'A'; 

	}
}
```

Instead of just printing a name, you can also store variables.
In the code snippet above, all three types of variables, `int`, `boolean`, and 
`char`, are being used and being given values to.

# Takeaways
+ basic syntax
+ Do research before choosing your topic.
+ Do not jump head first into something without knowing what you are getting yourself into.
+ Different languages are connected and knowing one will help you learn the others.
